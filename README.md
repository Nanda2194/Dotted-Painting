# 🎨 Dotted Painting with Python 🐢
# 📌 Project Overview
This project generates a dotted painting using Python's Turtle, Colorgram, and Random modules. The idea is inspired by pointillism, where small dots of color create an artistic effect.
# 🚀 Technologies Used
🐢 Turtle - For drawing the dots
🎨 Colorgram - For extracting colors from an image
🎲 Random - To randomly pick colors
# 🔧 How It Works
Extract colors from an image using colorgram.extract()
Store RGB values in a list
Use Turtle to draw a grid of colorful dots
Randomly pick colors to make each dot unique
